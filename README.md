# 💼 IT Salary Survey Analysis (2018–2020) 📊

## 🧾 Project Overview
This project explores salary trends among IT professionals across Europe using three years of anonymous salary survey data (2018–2020). The goal is to uncover insights related to compensation patterns based on job roles, experience levels, locations, company types, and technologies used in the industry.

The dataset includes rich demographic and professional details from multiple years, allowing for both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis.

## 📁 Dataset Sources
All datasets are sourced from Kaggle:

🔗 [2020 IT Salary Survey for EU Region](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/2020-it-salary-survey-for-eu-region)

Includes:
- `IT Salary Survey EU 2018.csv`
- `T Salary Survey EU 2019.csv`
- `IT Salary Survey EU 2020.csv`

Each file contains anonymized responses covering:
- Age
- Gender
- Location (City, Country)
- Job Title
- Seniority Level
- Years of Experience
- Salary Figures
- Tech Stack / Domain
- Company Size
- Employment Type
- Industry Focus

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key trends in IT salaries.
- Compare salary changes over time (2018–2020).
- Analyze how **experience**, **location**, **job type**, and **technology stack** affect income.
- Visualize and report findings clearly for HR teams, job seekers, and policymakers.

## 🧩 Methodology
### 1. **Data Integration**
- Load and normalize all three datasets.
- Merge them into a unified DataFrame with a new `Year` column.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Handle missing values appropriately.
- Normalize categorical variables (e.g., job titles, seniority levels).
- Convert inconsistent formats for numerical fields like salary.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Summary statistics: mean, median, min/max salaries.
- Salary distributions by role, country, year.
- Correlation between salary and experience/company size.
- Time-based visualizations (trends from 2018–2020).

### 4. **Insights & Reporting**
- Top-paying roles and technologies.
- Comparison of salary growth between years.
- Gender pay gap analysis (if data permits).
- Country-wise salary rankings.
- Recommendations for professionals and employers.
